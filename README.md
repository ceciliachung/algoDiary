# üìñ Algorithms Tracking Diary üìñ

Decided to save some of the algos I find interesting on a repo so I can revisit anytime~

Mainly working on leetcode problems of Easy and Medium difficulty, as this is my first job search as a software engineer upon graduating from my coding bootcamp. üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

List was sourced from [here](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU), minus the premium problems, plus a couple of problems I got from other various sources.

Started solving the problems only on the leetcode platform, but realized that it is hard to keep track of different solutions on leetcode, and having the problems and solutions on VScode helps with that.
